							<h3>What is Relatables?</h3>
							
							<p>Relatables provides a place for you to ask the world questions and share thoughts you wouldn’t normally feel comfortable asking. Submit your questions and let people from all around the world answer you. Scroll through our collection of user-submitted questions and see what you relate to!</p>
							
							<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
							
							<p class="pmv">Posting:</p>
							<p>To get started, click on the input field in the submission module. You have 300 characters to compose your post.  It must start with “Am I the only one” and end with a question mark, if necessary. Choose the category it falls into and click submit once you’re finished.</p>
							
							<p class="pmv">Moderating:</a>
							<p>Once you submit your question, it goes through our moderation process where other users decide if it follows our criteria. The votes it receives ultimately decides whether your post makes it to the front page or not.</p>
							
							<p class="pmv">Voting:</p>
							<p>When your post has been approved, other users will be able to vote on it. Using the voting buttons, users may choose, “No, me too!” if they relate or “You’re alone” if they don’t. Users are also able to discuss the post with others in the comment section.</p>
