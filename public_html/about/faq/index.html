					<h3>What is Relatablez?</h3>
					
					<p>Relatablez is a compilation of user-submitted posts starting with the phrase "Am I the only one". We offer users the opportunity to share their thoughts, secrets, fears; you name it, only to discover how similar we truly are.</p>
					
					<hr>
					
					<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
					
					<p>To get started, click "Submit" at the top of the page. Each submission must start with "Am I the only one" followed by your submission. For it to be approved, your submission must go through our moderation process where users decide if it follows our rules. As soon as your submission is online, users are able to start voting using the buttons, "No, me too!" and "You're alone." Users are also able to chat about the submission in the comment section.</p>
					
					<hr>
					
					<h3>Why Should I Sign Up?</h3>

					<h3>Why Has My Submission Not Been Approved?</h3>
					
					<p>
						Each submission must go through a moderation process to make sure it follows our guidelines and rules.
